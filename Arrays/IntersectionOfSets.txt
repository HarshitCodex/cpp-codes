For example, consider there are three sets {1,2,2,3,4} {2,2,3,5,6} {1,3,2,2,6}. The intersection of the given sets should be {2,2,3}

The following is an efficient approach to solve this problem.

1. Sort all the sets.
2. Take the smallest set, and insert all the elements, and their frequencies into a map.
3. For each element in the map do the following
…..a. If the element is not present in any set, ignore it
…..b. Find the frequency of the element in each set (using binary search). If it less than the frequency in the map, update the frequency
…..c. If the element is found in all the sets, add it to the result.

Here is the C++ implementation of the above approach.
