Ropes of diff size is given, all have to be joined. When joined, the cost = sum of individual rope length.
Maintain a min-heap.
First push all elements of array into it.
Then while it is not empty, pop the top two elements from it, add it and push them to the same heap.
When the heap has only one element, the element will be the final cost.
